# eulertools
A collection of useful math-based tools I designed for personal use with Project Euler problems.

This library of modules/functions is not meant to give answers to Project Euler problems. Rather, it is 
meant to be a toolset to aid in completing some of the more difficult problems. I started building up this 
library after noticing I was having to copy and paste parts of my own code from prior solutions. Rather than 
use built-in modules or other people's code off of the internet, I thought it would be a good learning 
experience to build up a collection from scratch.

Currently, this library contains nine modules but doesn't have all of the most efficient algorithms available. So far, I have implemented the Baillie-PSW primality test to replace the optimized brute-force trial division I had before. I plan to implement a more efficient factorization algorithm next, along with increasing the number of functions as necessary.

I have plans to move this library over to C/C++ to improve runtime.
